### Hello there! ðŸ‘‹

My journey, fueled by a profound fascination with Artificial Intelligence and its transformative capabilities, commenced within the halls of academia, where I dedicated myself to shaping the minds of future technologists as an Assistant Professor and Lecturer.

While my focus was primarily on molding the next generation of innovators, my career path has now led me to the threshold of industry. As I stand on the cusp of this new chapter, I am excited by the prospect of channeling my expertise and passion into tangible projects within the AI industry.

Although my time in academia was marked by a commitment to education, I now eagerly anticipate the opportunity to engage in hands-on industry experience. Drawing from a foundation rooted in innovation and education, I've spearheaded initiatives to redefine educational paradigms, empowering students with practical skills in mobile app development, data mining, and beyond.

As I delve deeper into the labyrinth of AI, each discovery ignites a newfound excitement within me. I am eager to unlock the potential of this burgeoning field and make meaningful contributions to its ever-evolving landscape in the realm of industry.
